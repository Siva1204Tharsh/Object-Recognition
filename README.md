# Real-Time Object recognition using Pre-Trained Model {MobileNet SSD}
Object recognition is a computer vision technique for identifying objects in images or videos. Object recognition is a key output of deep learning and machine learning algorithms. When humans look at a photograph or watch a video, we can readily spot people, objects, scenes, and visual details.

Helps to load pre-trained Model from DL frameworks such as TensorFlow , Caffe , Darknet , Torch
